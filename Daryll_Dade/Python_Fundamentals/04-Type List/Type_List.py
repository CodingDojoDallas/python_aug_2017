# Write a program that takes a list and prints a message for each element in the list, based on that element's data type.
# Your program input will alwyas be a list. fore each item in the list, test its data type.  If the item is a string, concentrate it onto a new string.
# If it is a number, add it to a running sum.  At the end of your program print the string, the number, and an analysiss of what the array contains.
# If it contains only one type pront that type otherwise print 'mixed'.
