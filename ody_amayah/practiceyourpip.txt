Installed Django and the requirements are satisfied.
Pip list brings up a bunch of weird list of installs
Already installed and the requirements are still satisfied.
Pip freeze brings up a list also like the pip list but with a different number.
Pip freeze > requirements.txt created a .txt file that has  the pip list.

Y and it successfully uninstalled Django.
Pip show Django brings out nothing
Pip search Flask seems to be loading and Iâ€™m waiting for the files to show up.It brought up a lot of flasked installs.
